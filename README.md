# String Encryption

This was my first Honors Project for my CS 131 class. We were to propose a project that used at least three functions in any capacity. I chose to do a simple string encrypter to push my understanding of C++ a little bit more.

# What I Learned

* How to manipulate ASCII values of characters depending on a varity of conditions
* How to properly declare, organize, and manage funtions in C++
